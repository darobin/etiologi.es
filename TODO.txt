        - explorable data from offline, larger runs
    - open questions
    - sticky headers
    - random graphs basics
        - the different properties of the basic random graphs
        - algorithms to build them

BUILD SYSTEM:
    ✓ Babel
    ✓ CleanCSS
    ✓ browserify
    ✓ nodemon
    - CSS built to hashed component, cached forever
    - JS built to several hashed components, depending on the page
        - need to support dependencies
    - libs needs to be able to run in the browser but also in Node
        - it should be possible to run complex computations in S3 or similar
    - definitions and cross-linking

PROJECTS:
    - SOC
        - reprise the demo for undefined
        - explain it a lot more
        - more interactive
        - ask questions, then answer then in code
            - does topology influence avalanches?
            - are there rules governing how long a grain of sand stays on the table?
    - Origins of Order notes
    - s/b model, a complete implementation
        - this might enable a tie-in with social evolution
    - WebLogo, port of NetLogo
    - see #etiologies in Evernote

WRITING:
    - how http://www.3quarksdaily.com/3quarksdaily/2015/05/how-informative-is-the-concept-of-biological-information.html can
      be fixed by applying the epistemology in Calculi of Emergence
    - actually write up a full epistemology, based on CoE and other assumptions. It is particularly
      important to clarify the centrality of information and computation, with help notably from
      The Annotated Turing and probably from Quantum Computing Since Democritus. It may be worth
      pointing at issues with Deutsch's epistemology in Four Strands.

ORGANISATION:
    - front page lists latest items and categorised items
    - need a section that is basically just "concepts" and the such (e.g. Criticality)
    - when any page has an open question, it is extracted and collated in a central list
    - definitions can be linked to easily

INFORMATION:
    ✓ about page with goals
        - short description of self
        - how to contribute
    - reading list
    - list of read books and papers, with summaries
    - DFNs
