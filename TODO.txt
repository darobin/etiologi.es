        - generating index page
        - news sources
    - start rsyncing
    - write SOC description
    - definition indexer
    - avalanches experiment
    - browserify
        - explorable data from offline, larger runs
    - open questions
    - sticky headers
    - random graphs basics
        - the different properties of the basic random graphs
        - algorithms to build them
        - visual explanations of their properties
    - avalanches on various topologies
    - NK model
    - rugged landscapes
    - RBNs
    - RBNs on various topologies
    - the simplest s/b model
    - metrics on random graphs (http://arxiv.org/abs/1005.1397? SFI video Antoine Allard)
    - dimensions (time-like, space-like) on a graph through information theoretic notions

BUILD SYSTEM:
    - 6to5
    - browserify
    - nodemon
    - CSS built to hashed component, cached forever
    - JS built to several hashed components, depending on the page
        - need to support dependencies
    - libs needs to be able to run in the browser but also in Node
        - it should be possible to run complex computations in S3 or similar
    - definitions and cross-linking

STYLE:
    - reprise headers and text style from undefined
    - and general decoration using patterns generated from http://riccardoscalco.github.io/textures

PROJECTS:
    - SOC
        - reprise the demo for undefined
        - explain it a lot more
        - more interactive
        - ask questions, then answer then in code
            - does topology influence avalanches?
            - are there rules governing how long a grain of sand stays on the table?
    - Origins of Order notes
    - s/b model, a complete implementation
        - this might enable a tie-in with social evolution

ORGANISATION:
    - front page lists latest items and categorised items
    - need a section that is basically just "concepts" and the such (e.g. Criticality)
    - when any page has an open question, it is extracted and collated in a central list
    - definitions can be linked to easily

INFORMATION:
    - about page with goals
        - short description of self
        - how to contribute
