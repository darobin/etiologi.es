      <dt><a href="piano-roll/">One-Dimensional Avalanche Piano Roll</a></dt>
      <dd>
        This runs <a>avalanches</a> on a one-dimensional lattice (that does not loop around) and
        renders them in a piano-roll that shows where they occur in time, the idea being to see if
        they might lend themselves to <a>particle analysis</a>.
