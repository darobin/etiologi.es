    <p>
      Etiologies is a web site that is maintained as 
      <a href="https://github.com/darobin/etiologi.es">an open source project</a> to which anyone
      can contribute. Its core goal is to «tinker with natural philosophy» using Web technologies.
      It is a broad remit, deliberately.
    </p>
    <p>
      The project’s tenets are:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Natural philosophy is most interesting when its propositions can be implemented as code that
        lends itself to <em>in silico</em> experiments.
      </li>
      <li>
        Such code is best when it is easily tinkered with so that anyone can tweak it whichever way
        in order to experiment and build up intuition.
      </li>
      <li>
        It is even better if the code in question is modular and reusable, as well as documented, so
        that you can plug something into something else just to see what happens.
      </li>
      <li>
        These tinkerings are best if they can be shared on the Web and demonstrated directly online
        as 
        «<a href="http://www.maartenlambrechts.be/the-rise-of-explorable-explanations/">explorable
        explanations</a>».
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      My primary initial focus is on complexity and criticality, but I’m open to contributions on
      other topics as well.
    </p>
    <p>
      I claim no expertise. I am simply having fun and tinkering.
